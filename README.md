## Mini-Project-01
ResNets (or Residual Networks) are one of the most commonly used models for image classification
tasks. In this project, you will design and train your own ResNet model for CIFAR-10 image
classification. In particular, your goal will be to maximize accuracy on the CIFAR-10 benchmark
while keeping the size of your ResNet model under some specified fix budget. Model size, typically
measured as the number or trainable parameters, is important when models need to be stored on
devices with limited storage capacity (e.g. IoT/edge devices).
